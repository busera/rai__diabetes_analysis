# Exploring Microsoft Responsible AI Toolkit with Diabetes Dataset

## Project Description

This project applies the Microsoft Responsible AI toolkit to the scikit-learn Diabetes dataset, focusing on gaining practical experience with the toolkit and understanding its metrics in a real-world machine learning context. Key components explored include fairness assessment, interpretability techniques, and error analysis. The project aims to demonstrate responsible AI practices in healthcare-related machine learning, potentially improving model transparency and reducing bias in medical predictions.

## Dataset Description

This project utilizes the Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn, a well-established dataset in the machine learning community. Here are key details about the dataset:

- **Source**: The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
- **Target**: The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.
- **Features**: The dataset contains 10 baseline variables:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Body Mass Index (BMI)
  - Average Blood Pressure
  - Six blood serum measurements
- **Samples**: It contains 442 samples.
- **Task**: The primary task is regression, predicting the quantitative measure of disease progression.
- **Ethical Considerations**: As this dataset relates to health information, it's crucial to consider privacy and fairness implications in its use and analysis.

This dataset provides a realistic scenario for applying responsible AI practices, as healthcare applications often involve sensitive data and have significant real-world impacts.
